When plants of the same kind are cultivated at one place on a large scale, it is called a  crop . For example, crop of wheat means that all the plants grown in a field are that of wheat. You already know that crops are of different types like cereals, vegetables and fruits. These can be classified on the basis of the season in which they grow. India is a vast country. The climatic conditions like temperature, humidity and rainfall vary from one region to another. Accordingly, there is a rich You have learnt that all living organisms require food. Plants can make their food themselves. Can you recall how green plants synthesise their own food? Animals including humans can not make their own food. So, where do animals get their food from? But, first of all why do we have to eat food? You already know that energy from the food is utilised by organisms for carrying out their various body functions, such as digestion, respiration and excretion. We get our food from plants, or animals, or both. Since we all need food, how can we provide food to a large number of people in our country? Food has to be produced on a large scale. I want to know where and how we use these tools. 2018-19 SCIENCE 2 variety of crops grown in different parts of the country. Despite this diversity, two broad cropping patterns can be identified. These are: (i) Kharif Crops :  The crops which are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops. The rainy season in India is generally from June to September. Paddy, maize, soyabean, groundnut and cotton are kharif crops. (ii) Rabi Crops :  The crops grown in the winter season (October to March) are called rabi crops. Examples of rabi crops are wheat, gram, pea, mustard and linseed. Besides these, pulses and vegetables are grown during summer at many places.\",\n",
