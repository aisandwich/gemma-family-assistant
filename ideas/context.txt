Lets again briain storm

I have gemma 3n 4b model, this can work on text, images and audio (gemma3n:e4b            15cb39fd9394    7.5 GB    5 days ago ). Route voice and images to this model.

I have gemma 3n 4b fintuned model, this cannot work with images, audio, only works with text (gemma-family:latest    e978f6e2e10a    7.3 GB    16 hours ago). Model is finetuned on datasets, so this can answer questions from all the domains. Route questions to this model

Now build Education tab.
Context:
student can ask two types of question:
1. general
2. Page based

for example, this is a general question:
Explain the importance of irrigation in crop production. What are different irrigation methods, and how do they impact water usage and crop yields?

Page based question:
In page 199, explain about best practices of crop production

For each question:
- For general question, get it from rag first. Append the data along with question.
identify the page numbers and they might have images, get the images, pass one by one to Gemma and ask it to explain
- For page based question, get it from structured json. Append the data along with question.
identify the page numbers and they might have images, get the images, pass one by one to Gemma and ask it to explain


Streamlit requirements:
- student can ask a question
- you check if it is page based or general
- if general, do rag -> get relevant info -> if images found, send them to gemma, get what it says + send the text from Rag and ask it to explain
- if page based -> just extract the info from page, images, send them to gemma and get explaination


lets first build this in notebook and then we can ship it to streamlit.
