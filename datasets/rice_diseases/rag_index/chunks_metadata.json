The fungus reproductive structures, spores, can spread from these two sources to rice plants during the next growing season and initiate new infections. Spores from these new infections can spread by wind to other rice plants over great distances. The conidiophores of the pathogen are produced in clusters from each stoma. They are rarely solitary with 2-4 septa. The basal area of the conidiophores is swollen and tapers toward the lighter apex. The conidia of the fungus measure 20-22 x 10-12 µm. The conidia are 2-septate, translucent, and slightly darkened. They are obclavate and tapering at the apex. They are truncate or extended into a short tooth at the base.",

Infected seeds give rise to infected seedlings. The fungus can spread from plant to plant and in the field by airborne spores.​ The disease is common in nutrient-deficient soils and unflooded soil but rare on rice grown on fertile soils.​ Abnormal soils, which are deficient in nutrient elements, or soils in a much-reduced condition in which toxic substances accumulate favor the development of the disease.",

Seed treatment with Agrosan or Ceresan 2.5 g/kg seed to ward off seedling blight stage; Spraying copper fungicides to control secondary spread; Grisepfulvin, nystatin, aureofungin, and similar antibiotics have been found effective in preventing primary seedling infection.

Use  Resistant varieties like IR 36,  IR 50 ,ADT 37,  Ponmani, Co 45, Co 48, Surekha, Vikramarya, Bharani, IR 36 white ponni . Among the cultural management practices, adjusting the date of planting is recommended. Likewise, observing a fallow period of at least a month to eliminate hosts and viruses and vectors of the disease. In epidemic areas follow rotation with pulses or oil seeds. Apply neem cake @ 12.5 kg/20 cent nursery as basal dose. plouging and harrowing the field to destroy stubbles right after harvest in order to eradicate other tungro hosts are also advisable. Destruction of weed hosts on bunds.",

Application of a systemic pesticide,Tridemorph (a fungicide) and phosphamidon (an insecticide) in combination protected the plants from sheath rot. Seed treatment with fungicides such as Mancozeb and Benomyl effectively eliminate seedborne inoculum. At booting stage, foliar spraying with carbendazim, edifenphos, or mancozeb was found to reduce sheath rot. Spray Carbendazim 250 g or Chlorothalonil 1 kg or Edifenphos 1 lit/ha. Foliar spraying with Benomyl and copper oxychloride were also found to be effective.",

On the leaf sheath oval or elliptical or irregular greenish grey spots are formed. As the spots enlarge, the centre becomes greyish white with an irregular blackish brown or purple brown border. Lesions on the upper parts of plants extend rapidly coalesing with each other to cover entire tillers from the water line to the flag leaf. The presence of several large lesions on a leaf sheath usually causes death of the whole leaf, and in severe cases all the leaves of a plant may be blighted in this way. The infection extends to the inner sheaths resulting in death of the entire plant. Older plants are highly susceptible.",

Younger spores are smaller, paler, and almost smooth. Some of the green spore balls develop one to four sclerotia in the center. These sclerotia overwinter in the field and produce stalked stromata the following summer or autumn. In temperate regions, the fungus survives the winter by means of sclerotia as well as chlamydospores. It is believed that the primary infections are initiated mainly by the ascospores produced from the sclerotia. Chlamydospores play an important role in secondary infection, which is a major part of the disease cycle.",

Use varieties that are found to be resistant or tolerant against the disease in India. Avoid field activities when the plants are wet.

This will reduce primary inoculum for the next crop. Field bunds and irrigation channels should be kept clean to eliminate alternate hosts. Excess application of nitrogenous fertilizer should be avoided. Regular monitoring of disease incidence during rabi season is very essential. Proper Destruction of straw and stubble.",

Providing good drainage system especially in seedbeds can also manage this disease. Planting of resistant varieties (IR 20, TKM 6) is the most effective method of controlling bacterial leaf streak. Grow nurseries preferably in isolated upland conditions Avoid clipping of seedlings during transplanting. Spray fresh cowdung water extract or lemon grass or mint extract at 20 %.",
