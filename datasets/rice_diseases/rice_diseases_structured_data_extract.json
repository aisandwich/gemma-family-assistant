The infection may be external or internal causing discoloration of the glumes or kernels or both. Dark brown or black spots appear on the grains. The discolouration may be red, yellow, orange, pink or black, depending upon the organism involved and the degree of infection. This disease is responsible for quantitative and qualitative losses of grains.",

At tillering and preflowering stages, spraying of carbendazim fungicide and copper base fungicide can effectively control the disease. Pre and post-harvest measures should be taken into account for prevention of grain discolouration. Spray the crop at bootleaf stage with Mancozeb 1 kg or Iprobenphos 500 ml or Carbendazim 250 g/ha. Store the grains with 13.5-14% moisture content.",
